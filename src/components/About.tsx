            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">👋 Hey there! I’m a first-year undergrad who thought college meant just lectures and canteen chai… but nope, I fell into the React.js rabbit hole. ⚛️
Currently on a mission to become a full-stack dev before my first semester ends (yes, sleep is optional).
Backend, frontend—if it has “end” in it, I wanna master it. 🚀
After that? Off to explore the mysterious realms of AI & ML (because why stop at websites when you can teach machines to think?). 🤖
Basically: code, caffeine, and crazy goals.
Stick around—I might just debug my way to glory. 😎
